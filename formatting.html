<h1>Metaphor</h1>
<p><b>Metaphor could be regarded as a literature device <mark>(Carter <sub>2004</sub>)</mark> and defined as making use of a conceptual domain to understand another conceptual domain <mark>(Kovecses 2010)</mark>.</b></p>
<p><strong>It is in &quot;<i>The sea and the sky were welded together without a joint&quot;</i> in HD.</strong></p>
<p><em>The literary meaning of this metaphor is the blending of the sea and the sky, while the edge is blurred.</em></p> 
<p><small>The merge of the sea and sky is metaphorised as metals are perfectly welded together with no joint.</small></p>
<p><del>This portrait of welding could be regarded as pattern reforming that the linguistic manipulation restructures our usual perception about the sea and the sky.</del></p>
<p><ins>This portrait of welding could be regarded as pattern reforming that the linguistic manipulation restructures our usual perception about the sea and the sky.</ins></p>
<p>By applying the metaphor, it seems to us that the sea line separating the sea and the sky is vanished or unseen, which implies the unclearness of the sea-sky view.</p>
<p>This unclearness supports the meaning of vagueness of the whole picture which is depicted in the book Hear of Darkness by Conrad <mark>(Stubbs <sup>2005</sup>)</mark>.</p>
